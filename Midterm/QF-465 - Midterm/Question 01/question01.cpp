/*
Question 01:

Write a function which will take V, K, and L and empty vector Results
and return as Results the L closest integers in V to K.

Assume V is always sorted.

Example:
 * V = [0,2,5,7,9]
 * K = 3
 * L = 2
 * Then Results = [2, 5]
 * 
Example:
 * V = [-1,2,6,7]
 * K = -2
 * L = 4
 * Results = [-1,2,6,7]
