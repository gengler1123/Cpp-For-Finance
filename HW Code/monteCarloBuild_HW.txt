Homework Assignment:

1) Finish the code as written using vector methods.

2) Optimize the code so the HOLD vector is unnecessary.
Hint: Do loops have to iterate forwards 0-N?

3) Convert the code into a function that given integer parameter N, and float parameter R > 0 whether in a single instance of the randomly generated field of N stones where you can jump R distance you would be able to get to the finish.
